# UM25C

Very simple web application running in a browser that connects to UM25C over BLE to read and control device.

It directly replaces the https://github.com/kolinger/rd-usb.

It just requires browser, and is single HTML. Access it via https://um25c.ayufan.dev/.

## iOS/iPadOS

To use it on iOS/iPadOS you need to install BLE enabled web-browser, like: [Bluefy](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055?l=pl).
